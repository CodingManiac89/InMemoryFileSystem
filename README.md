5. Optimized the recursion call of the Prefix search
6. Added tests for the creation and search functionalities
7. Moving of the files/folders from one directory to other


### The time complexity of retrieval of Directory is O(1)
### The time complexity of the deletion and move of the entries is O(K) where k is depth of deleted or moved node


### Upcoming functionalities
1. Copying of the files and folders from one directory to other
